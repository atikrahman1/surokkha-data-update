# surokkha-data-update
This is a automation script created to check if the covid-19 vaccination registration data has been added to the govt server https://surokkha.gov.bd/foreigner-enroll . Instead of checking again and again running this script with cron jobs  it will auto check if the data has been added and send notification to a slack channel.
